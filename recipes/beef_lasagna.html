      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>9 dry lasagna noodles, uncooked</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>

      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt's® Petite Diced Tomatoes, undrained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with
        cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons water, parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon
        black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion; sprinkle
        with remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, Italian seasoning, and salt.
        Cook 7 minutes or until beef is crumbled and no longer pink, stirring
        occasionally. Add garlic; cook 1 minute more or until fragrant. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining water, undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, vinegar, and red
        pepper flakes to the skillet. Reduce heat and simmer meat sauce 10
        minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble lasagna by spreading about 1 cup meat sauce over bottom of the
        baking dish. Place 3 dry noodles over sauce. Top with 2 cups meat sauce,
        half of the ricotta mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 cup
        Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of noodles. Top with
        remaining meat sauce and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray underside of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover dish tightly
        with foil. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake 15 minutes more or
        until cheese melts and sauce is bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes before
        serving.
