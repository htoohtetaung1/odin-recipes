          This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my
          grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in
          the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was
          cooked.

      <div class="steps-text smallfont">
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out
            with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter
            in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the
            outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the
            chicken cavity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at
            the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
            thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum
            foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.
